    <h3 class = "subhead subhead14">1.1) Describing the Content and Layout For Each Page</h3>

    <p class = "para para14">I plan to play about a little first before I make a decision on how I want my website to look. 
        I doing this so I can play about and get familiar with the tools and techniques. 
        This is because its my first time working with HTML and therefore I don’t know what is going to be possible and what is not going to be possible. 
        After doing a bit of a play around with colours I have decided that I want to use a dark grey with white text and a darkish yellow of links and other things. 
        I felt that it looked the best when I was messing about and I really like the dark mode on websites because its clear and easy to read without being so bright and annoying. 
        The yellow for links is good because it stands outs telling the user that this is a link I also found that having yellow around the images looked good so I plan to use that as well. 
        I have also decided that I want the title at the top with the links to other HTML programs at the top making the website easier to navigate round. 
        I thought that having a image of some code at the top would be nice just to separate the text and the nav bar. 
        I want the assignment title in the middle with the blog title then each task below an slightly right of the page with the information from each task below. 
        I want to keep the top image and the task bar and blog title the same in each page giving it some consistency.
        I have also played around with some font families to see which ones are the best and  I found that “Rubik” and “Noto Sans” was the best choice because they looked nice clear and modern. Because its a blog I find them things to be very important. 
        Another thing I want in my website is a click here to go back to top that I see on a lot of websites. 
        I want this because my websites a blog and has lots of text taking up a lot of space having a back to top link would make the website easier to navigate.
        </p>

    <h3 class = "subhead subhead15">1.5) Describing Copyright and Other Constraints Affecting Websites</h3>

    <p class = "para para15">Copyright protection is a law that protects original works. 
        It makes it legal to copy someone's work and claim it as your own. This extends to websites. 
        Once a website has been made I can if I want register it with the U.K as my website protecting it from people who might want to use it as their own. 
        This is something that happens a lot on the internet so if I want to do if I keep using my blog. It protects it across bords meaning that even if your in a different country it would still be illegal to copy my work if copyrighted. 
        Overall I think that copyright law is really in the favour of websites as long as people don’t copy each other all should be fine for me and other companies making websites.

    <h3 class = "subhead subhead16">1.6) Describing Access Issues That Need Taking Into Account.</h3>

    <p class = "para para16">If a person is blind it could be really hard to use the internet because you cannot see.
        The keyboard as some bumps on “f” and “j” so a blind person can type.
        There is also software that can read web text allowed and computers are equipped with voice interaction so they could interact with it that way.
        My blog is coloured black and white making it easy for colour blind people to use.
        I could make my website able you change language for people that don’t read english.   
        </p>
    
    <h3 class = "subhead subhead17">1.7) Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites</h3>
    
    <div>
            <h4 class = "subsubhead subsubhead4"> PNG (Portable Network Graphics)</h4>

            <p class = "subpara subpara4">is a type of file that displays images. 
                The benefits of a png file is that it can made semi transparent and if you change the size it keeps the image quality. 
                This is good for logos and most companies use it for that purpose . 
                I will not use png files for my website because I have no need to make an image transparent and im not making a logo because I don’t need one.
            </p>

            <h4 class = "subsubhead subsubhead5">JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)</h4>

            <p class = "subpara subpara5">Is a file type that also displays images. 
                It's very common to have normal images on websites use JPEG because you can compress it to save memory. 
                I will use it on my website because it will because it will not consume as much space and look good because jpegs display more colours then PNG’s and still have a lot of detail for a compressed image.
                </p>

            <h4 class = "subsubhead subsubhead6">.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h4>

            <p class = "subpara subpara6">Is a tool that allows the developer to make style choices to the website. 
                It connects to your HTML file and can read the tags in the HTML in order to make changes to it when its displayed. 
                It's critical to use CSS because it can make loads of changes without much time and effort. 
                I used it to insert the colours,font size,font colour,font family,padding and to center images and text. 
                I think it's a critical tool in order to make your website look good with a consistent style which is what i want. 
                </p>

            <h4 class = "subsubhead subsubhead7">HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)</h4>

            <p class = "subpara subpara7"> Is a coding language that creates web pages. 
                When an internet browser opens a HTML it reads the lauge and turns it into a web page. 
                It's called hypertext because if you click on a hyperlink it could take you to anywhere on the internet. 
                I have made my website using HTML and I think it's really good. 
                I can open it up using chrome meaning I can check if its coming out correct.
                </p>

            <h4 class = "subsubhead subsubhead8">MP3 (MPEG Layer 3 Sound File)</h4>

            <p class = "subpara subpara8">MP3 (MPEG Layer 3 Sound File) is a sound file. 
                It can compress sound in to a very small file size without taking much room. 
                If I wanted to put some sound in to my blog I would use this but because my website is a blog I do not find it appropriate.
