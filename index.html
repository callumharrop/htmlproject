        <h3 id = who> Who I'm I</h3>
        <p id = whop1>My name is Callum I’m a nerd who loves sci-if, video games and computers. 
            I’m very knowledgeable, creative and logical. I'm currently learning how to code at the moment. 
            I have coded a basic version of naughts and crosses.
            I've currently been trying to make a slot machine in Java Script. 
            I'm really enjoying coding its been very fun. </p>
        <h3 id = why> Why I'm I doing this </h3>
        <p id = whyp1> This page is made for my assessment. 
            I currently developing my skills in using html. I coded this page myself using Visual Code Studio. 
            This task has got me to push myself to learn more about working in HTML and CSS.</p>
        <h3 id = whyc> Why Codenation </h3>
        <p id = whycp> I joined <a class="yellowtext" href = "https://wearecodenation.com/codenation/">Code Nation</a> because I really wanted to broaden my I.T skills and expand my knowledge. 
            I have always had a passion for computers but I never pursued it in in a educational sense till now. 
            I quite like it here at codenation they got very nice tea making area and its a very chilled out environment. 
            I also want to get some form of qualifications in I.T so I can hopefully get better luck at getting a good job. </p>
